# 📸 **Image-Based Product Description Generator**

This Python project is designed to generate marketing-oriented product descriptions based on images. It uses a vision-language model called **SmolVLM-Instruct**, which interprets both images and text. The model analyzes a given image and produces a compelling product description based on it. 📝✨
